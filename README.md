## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on medical image classification using deep learning to detect breast cancer from ultrasound images.
The dataset contains images labeled as benign, malignant, or normal, and the objective is to train a model capable of identifying cancerous lesions with high accuracy.

Breast ultrasound imaging is non-invasive, widely accessible, and crucial for early cancer detection — making automated analysis highly valuable in clinical settings.
